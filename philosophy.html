				<h2>TEACHING PHILOSOPHY</h2>
				</br>
				<p>SINGING IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING AND DYNAMIC FORMS OF SELF EXPRESSION. LEARNING TO SING CAN INCREASE AN INDIVIDUAL'S CREATIVITY AND MUSICAL ABILITY. IT CAN IMPROVE FOCUS, DETERMINATION, AWARENESS, AND OPEN-MINDEDNESS IN ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE. AS A VOICE TEACHER, I BELIEVE THE PROCESS OF SINGING, THROUGH POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT, CAN HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE IN ONE'S SELF AND ONE'S ABILITIES. VOICE LESSONS CAN PROMOTE INDIVIDUALITY AND DISCOVERY OF UNIQUENESS THROUGH A FUN, ARTISTIC, AND SPONTANEOUS ENVIRONMENT. THROUGH STUDYING SINGING SPECIFICALLY, WE LEARN HOW TO UNITE BODY, VOICE, AND MIND, GAINING BETTER INSIGHT, CONTROL, AND FREEDOM OF OURSELVES. I BELIEVE EVERYONE POSSESSES THE TALENT, DESIRE, AND CAPABILITY TO CREATE MEANINGFUL ART THROUGH HIS OR HER OWN VOICE. <EM>EVERYONE</EM> CAN SING AND ENJOY THE MANY GIFTS MUSIC HAS TO OFFER!</p>
